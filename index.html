  <span><p>The Play with Kubernetes classroom is a new site that helps you get hands-on experience using Kubernetes. We provide a workshop that will allow you, in the browser, to follow a Kubernetes tutorial without having to install a single thing.</p></span>

    <p>We plan on offering more labs as time goes on. We welcome additional content contributions through the <a href="https://github.com/play-with-docker/play-with-kubernetes.github.io">Play-with-Kubernetes</a> repository on GitHub. In the meantime you might find the <a href="https://training.play-with-docker.com">Play with Docker Classroom</a> provides you with a wealth of other workshop and hands on labs to learn more about Docker.</p>
